# About

This work is produced using entirely free and open software in python.  

This model is independent research supported by the National Institute for Health Research Applied Research Collaboration South West Peninsula. The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the National Institute for Health Research or the Department of Health and Social Care.

## Modelling and Simulation Software

The model is written in `python3` and `simpy`.  The simulation libary `simpy` uses a **process based model worldview**.  Given its simplicity it is a highly flexible discrete-event simulation package.

One of the benefits of a package like `simpy` is that it is written in standard python and is free and open for others to use.  
* For research this is highly beneficial:
    * models and methods tested against them can be shared without concerns for commerical licensing.  
    * experimental results (either from model or method) can be recreated by other research teams.
    
* The version of `simpy` in use can also be controlled.  This avoids backwards compatibility problems if models are returned to after several years.

## Web App

The interactive web application was developed in `streamlit` and deployed freely, but with limited computational resources, on streamlit cloud.
